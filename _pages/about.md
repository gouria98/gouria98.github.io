I am a fourth year PhD candidate at LSU Biophysical Ocean Modeling lab. I am studying the impacts of solar climate intervention strategies, particularly, Stratospheric Aerosol Injection or SAI, on global coral reefs and other marine ecosystems. I aim to generate policy relevant research on climate intervention to inform scenario design and decision making.

I have a masters in physical oceanography from Cochin University of Science and Technology and completed my thesis research at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services. My work was on understanding the nature of marine heatwaves in the Arabian Sea region.
